                <p class="card-text p-3">
                  As a teenager I had always been interested in languages and
                  understanding others, so in high school I studied Modern
                  Languages & Science. I continued my journey as towards a
                  language expert at the University of Antwerp. <br />In 2023, I
                  have finished my Bachelor's degree in Applied Linguistics:
                  Dutch-French-Italian (Dutch being my native language) and am
                  currently finishing up my Master's degree in Translation with
                  the same languages.
                  <br />
                  As a big fan of Media Accessibility, I would like to focus on
                  SDH & sub-/surtitling after obtaining my degree.

                  How I stumbled onto coding
                </h6>
                <p class="card-text p-3">
                  At university I discovered HTML to understand how to localise
                  websites in another language and I found a hidden passion for
                  coding. Curious and having the time during the academic year,
                  I've searched for online courses which offer a certificate or
                  a even a degree. So I stumbled onto SheCodes to learn how to
                  code and become a Front-End Developer. While I still have some
                  codingworkshops left to do, I'm feeling very confident and
                  feeling proud of the results so far. Coding can be tricky at
                  moments, but I enjoy finding the solutions to problems or bugs
                  and showing my work to others.

                  What I do to relax
                </h6>
                <p class="card-text p-3">
                  Aside from my passion for languages and coding, there is my
                  passion for music: I play the flute and piccolo in a wind
                  orchestra, I've taught myself a bit of piano and I started to
                  learn how to play the trumpet. In the future I hope to add the
                  cello or even other instruments since I'm always curious about
                  how to play each instrument.
                  <br />
                  During the quiet hours of the day I prefer reading a
                  paranormal or urban fantasy romance book or I'm trying my luck
                  in fighting bosses in a computergame.
